My Drag and drop and sortable implementation for dnd

Currently I'm still experimenting in the draft branch.
For now I was able to put in place a DnD system that could be used for sortable (and can be upgraded to accept moving draggable from group to group)

## Draggable with different sizes
That's the current challenge I have now, this DnD is working perfectly if the draggables are the same sizes.
I'm working on this problem

## Auto Scroll
Not yet possible but not a big problem could be implemented easly.
